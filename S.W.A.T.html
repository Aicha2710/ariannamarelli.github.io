        <p class="paragrafo">A S.W.A.T. sergeant from the South Los Angeles area, former Marine Daniel 'Hondo' Harrelson, is assigned to head a specialized tactical unit that represents the final stop of Los Angeles law enforcement, in the premiere of the series.

            Torn between loyalty to the place where he grew up and loyalty to his brothers in blue, Hondo has what it takes to be an excellent leader and to act as a bridge between his two worlds. His elite unit includes David "Deacon" Kay, an experienced S.W.A.T. agent who always puts the team first, while feeling snubbed as a leader; Jim Street, a cheeky but promising new member of the group; Christina "Chris" Alonso, skilled officer and dog trainer of the team; Dominique Luca, expert driver who takes everyone in and out of the most dangerous situations; and Victor Tan, a relatively new S.W.A.T. officer who uses his confidential community informants to help the team. Overseeing the unit is Jessica Cortez, captain of the L.A. Metro for whom the work is worth more than anything else, including her secret relationship with Hondo. Hondo's team has an intense rivalry with another Los Angeles unit led by Mumford, an aggressive leader who likes to do things his own way. With Hondo in charge, these painstaking men and women bravely put themselves at risk to protect their community and save lives.</p>
