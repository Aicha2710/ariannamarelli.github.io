         <h2 class="swattitolo">Black Mirror</h2>
         <p class="paragrafo">Black Mirror is a British television series, produced by Charlie Brooker for Endemol Shine Group. It is an anthology series, as scenarios and characters are different in each episode. The fiction, set in the future, but actually inspired by today's world, focuses on current issues and the challenges posed by the introduction of new technologies, particularly in the field of media (the title in fact refers to the black screen of every television, computer or smartphone). It premiered on Channel 4 from 4 December 2011 and in Italy on Sky Cinema 1 from 10 October 2012. From the third season it is broadcast internationally on the Netflix streaming platform.</p>
    <h3 class="paragrafo">Plot</h3>
<p class="paragrafo">Each episode is in its own right, and the common thread of each is the progress and progress of new technologies, the addiction to them and their side effects. Different situations of the modern or future world are imagined and recreated in which a new technological invention or a paradoxical but realistic idea has, in some way, made society and human feelings unstable.
