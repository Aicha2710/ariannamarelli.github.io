         <h2 class="swattitolo">The Good Place</h2>
         <p class="paragrafo">The Good Place is an American fantasy television series created by Michael Schur. The series aired from September 19, 2016 to January 30, 2020 on NBC.

            The series centers on Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a woman who wakes up in the afterlife and meets Michael (Ted Danson) in "The Good Place", a highly selective and Heaven-like utopia that was designed by Michael, as a reward for leading a righteous life. She realizes that she was sent there by mistake and that she has to hide her morally flawed behavior and try to become an ethically better person. William Jackson Harper, Jameela Jamil and Manny Jacinto co-star like other residents of "The Good Place," along with D'Arcy Carden who plays Janet, an artificial being who helps the inhabitants.
            
            The Good Place has received positive reviews since the first episode. She was praised for her acting, screenplay, originality, setting, and tone, as well as her final twist at the end of the first season. Starting in 2017, NBC renewed the series until a fourth and final season.</p>

            <li><div class="personaggi">Eleanor Shellstrop</div>played by Kristen Bell and voiced by Francesca Manicone.
                Eleanor finds herself in the Good Part, after being hit by a pile of trolleys after shopping, and realizes that there has been an exchange of persons: she is not the Eleanor Shellstrop lawyer fighting for human rights described by Michael (and lover of a style of furniture full of clowns) but a former employee in call centers specializing in selling pills. He doesn't call himself a bad person, but neither does he define himself as someone who deserves to be in the Good Part. From here she involves Chidi, her soul mate, convincing him to teach her ethics to become a better person. </li>
            <li><div class="personaggi">Chidi Anagonye</div> played by William Jackson Harper and voiced by Riccardo Scarafoni.
                Chidi is a Nigerian ethics teacher and is the soulmate of Eleanor (or at least the real Eleanor). He is a very indecisive person, who takes every decision very seriously, evaluating every consequence and therefore taking a lot of time.</li>
            <li><div class="personaggi">Tahani Al-Jamil </div> played by Jameela Jamil and voiced by Gaia Bolognesi.
                Tahani is an English heiress, raised from an early age in the most unbridled luxury and frequenting only exclusive environments, full of celebrities (which she names from time to time). His soulmate is Jianyu Li, a Buddhist monk who took a vow of silence. In the Good Part he lives in a beautiful villa, furnished in a princely style, often causing a bit of envy in Eleanor.</li>
            <li><div class="personaggi">Janet</div>(seasons 1-4), played by D'Arcy Carden and voiced by Angela Brusa.
                Janet is a technological interface, in which every piece of information in the universe is concentrated. She is summoned every time someone says her name.</li>
            <li><div class="personaggi">Jason Mendoza</div>(seasons 1-4), played by Manny Jacinto and voiced by Davide Garbolino.
                Jianyu is presented as a Buddhist monk who took a vow of silence when he was very young. When he dies, Michael tells him that he can keep his vow if he wants, and this is what he does: his real name is Jason and he is a penniless thief from Jacksonville, not very smart.</li>
            <li><div class="personaggi">Michael</div>(seasons 1-4), played by Ted Danson and voiced by Mario Cordova.
                Michael is the one who designed The Good Part (the equivalent of Paradise): he runs it with Janet's help. </li>
